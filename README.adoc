= quill-asciidoc

A wrapper around https://quilljs.com/[Quill] that gives you WYSIWYG Asciidoc powers:

* allows pasting raw Asciidoc -- it gets translated into Quill formats
* allows calling `quill.setText()` with raw Asciidoc -- it gets translated into Quill formats
* allows exporting contents as Asciidoc with `quill.getAsciidoc()`

== Installation

---
npm i quill-asciidoc
---

== Usage

[source,typescript]
----
const quill = new QuillAsciidoc('#editor', {
  theme: 'snow',
})

quill.setText(`
= hello _world_

this is https://asciidoc.org/[*Asciidoc*], a reasonably good markup language^unlike markdown^

it has

* document metadata
* lists
** ordered
** unordered
*** with checklists
* superscript
* subscript
* nicer links syntax
* nicer image syntax
** much nicer image-with-link syntax
* tables
* blocks with metadata
* sidebars
* footnotes

> quotes are the same
> somewhat lame

CAUTION: Asciidoc has too many features, but only the most basic are supported by native Quill types and this library (definitely not all listed above).

----
code blocks are supported
(you can write them without the leading "[source]" thing if you prefer)
----

turns out Quill isn't a bad editor, but it _doesn't_ support https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59602182/quill-add-image-url-instead-of-uploading-it[adding images by URL easily].

this is fine as we can do it with `image::url[link=target]` in Asciidoc:

let adoc: string = quill.getAsciidoc()
console.log(adoc)
